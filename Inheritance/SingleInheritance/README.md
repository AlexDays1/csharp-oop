## Single Inheritance

**NOTE** : You need a public **StartUp** class with the namespace **Farm**.

Create two classes named **Animal** and **Dog** :

- **Animal** with a single public method **Eat()** that prints: **&quot;eating…&quot;**
- **Dog** with a single public method **Bark()** that prints: **&quot;barking…&quot;**
- **Dog** should inherit from **Animal**

| **Sample Main()** |
| --- |
| staticvoid Main(){Dog dog = new Dog();dog.Bark();dog.Bark();} |

### Hints

Use the **:**  **operator** to build a hierarchy
