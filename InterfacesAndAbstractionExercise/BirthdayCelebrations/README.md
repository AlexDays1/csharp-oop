## Birthday Celebrations

It is a well known fact that people celebrate birthdays, it is also known that some people also celebrate their pets&#39; birthdays. Extend the program from your last task to add **birthdates** to citizens and include a class **Pet** , pets have a **name** and a **birthdate**. Encompass repeated functionality into interfaces and implement them in your classes.

You will receive from the console an unknown amount of lines. Until the command &quot; **End**&quot; is received, each line will contain information in one of the following formats &quot; **Citizen \&lt;name\&gt; \&lt;age\&gt; \&lt;id\&gt; \&lt;birthdate\&gt;**&quot; for **Citizen** , &quot; **Robot**** \&lt;model\&gt; \&lt;id\&gt; **&quot; for** Robot **or &quot;** Pet \&lt;name\&gt; \&lt;birthdate **&quot; for** Pet **. After the &quot;** End **&quot; command on the next line you will receive a single number representing** a specific year**, your task is to print all birthdates (of both**Citizen **and** Pet**) in that yearin the format**day/month/year **in the** order **of** input**.
